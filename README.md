# Quantum_ML_Demo
A basic example of quantum machine learning.

## Installation:
Download the repository. You can use conda to install `environment.yml`, or manually install the required python packages (rdkit, pytdc, and pennylane).
Open the directory in your terminal, run the file with
`python qml_challenge`

The program will first ask you how many datapoints you want to use. You can use fewer than the default amount (comprising all datapoints) to save time, but avoid going below 50 or so.
Next it will ask if you want to test using the validation data or the test data. If you want to test the model, use test, and if you want to first refine it, choose validation to check the performance.
